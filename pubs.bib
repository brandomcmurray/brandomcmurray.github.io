	abstract = {Herbicide resistance is selected for within a weed population through the recurrent use of an herbicide. Once the use of the herbicide is reduced or discontinued, the trait may persist in the population unless resistance endows a fitness penalty. Few studies have examined the long-term persistence of an herbicide resistance trait in a weed population once the selection pressure that led to its prevalence has been removed. The objective of this research was to re-survey the locations described by A.J.J. Smisek in her 1995 study of a paraquat resistant biotype of C. canadensis on the grounds of the Harrow Research and Development Centre. Results indicate that, ∼20 yr after paraquat use was significantly reduced, a glyphosate resistant biotype had replaced the paraquat resistant biotype at all but one of the original locations surveyed by Smisek. The sole location where the paraquat resistant biotype was observed was an old, un-treed orchard row currently managed by mowing. This location not only served as a refuge for the paraquat resistant biotype, ensuring its persistence in the face of strong selection for glyphosate resistance at all other locations, but it facilitated the co-occurrence of glyphosate and paraquat resistant biotypes. The observation of a multiple resistant biotype at this location alone, with resistance to both paraquat and glyphosate, suggests a role for refugia in the stacking of herbicide resistance traits. Given that this stacking occurred in the absence of either herbicide, we hypothesize that the multiple resistant biotype arose through pollen mediated gene flow among biotypes.},

	abstract = {Background:
	Phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) gain-of-function mutations cause hypertension with brachydactyly (HTNB) and lead to stroke. Increased peripheral vascular resistance, rather than salt retention, is responsible. It is surprising that the few patients with HTNB examined so far did not develop cardiac hypertrophy or heart failure. We hypothesized that, in the heart, PDE3A mutations could be protective.
	Methods:
	We studied new patients. CRISPR-Cas9–engineered rat HTNB models were phenotyped by telemetric blood pressure measurements, echocardiography, microcomputed tomography, RNA-sequencing, and single nuclei RNA-sequencing. Human induced pluripotent stem cells carrying PDE3A mutations were established, differentiated to cardiomyocytes, and analyzed by Ca2+ imaging. We used Förster resonance energy transfer and biochemical assays.
	Results:
	We identified a new PDE3A mutation in a family with HTNB. It maps to exon 13 encoding the enzyme’s catalytic domain. All hitherto identified HTNB PDE3A mutations cluster in exon 4 encoding a region N-terminally from the catalytic domain of the enzyme. The mutations were recapitulated in rat models. Both exon 4 and 13 mutations led to aberrant phosphorylation, hyperactivity, and increased PDE3A enzyme self-assembly. The left ventricles of our patients with HTNB and the rat models were normal despite preexisting hypertension. A catecholamine challenge elicited cardiac hypertrophy in HTNB rats only to the level of wild-type rats and improved the contractility of the mutant hearts, compared with wild-type rats. The β-adrenergic system, phosphodiesterase activity, and cAMP levels in the mutant hearts resembled wild-type hearts, whereas phospholamban phosphorylation was decreased in the mutants. In our induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocyte models, the PDE3A mutations caused adaptive changes of Ca2+ cycling. RNA-sequencing and single nuclei RNA-sequencing identified differences in mRNA expression between wild-type and mutants, affecting, among others, metabolism and protein folding.
	Conclusions:
	Although in vascular smooth muscle, PDE3A mutations cause hypertension, they confer protection against hypertension-induced cardiac damage in hearts. Nonselective PDE3A inhibition is a final, short-term option in heart failure treatment to increase cardiac cAMP and improve contractility. Our data argue that mimicking the effect of PDE3A mutations in the heart rather than nonselective PDE3 inhibition is cardioprotective in the long term. Our findings could facilitate the search for new treatments to prevent hypertension-induced cardiac damage.},

	abstract = {Hypertension affects more than 1 billion people worldwide, causes cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure. PDE3A encodes phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3A. Exon 4 mutations encoding a region N-terminally from the catalytic domain cause hypertension with brachydactyly type E (HTNB). Untreated HTNB patients die from stroke prior to age 50 years. Surprisingly, despite hypertension, HTNB patients develop no cardiac damage. How the heart could be protected in HTNB is not clear. We identified a new PDE3A mutation in exon 13 encoding the enzyme's catalytic domain. CRISPR-Cas9-generated rat models of both mutations confirmed all HTNB phenotypes. Despite hypertension, the hearts of HTNB rats carrying mutations in either exon 4 or 13 were similar to wildtype rats, even in response to catecholamine infusions, as indicated by echocardiography. Protein and mRNA expressions were similar in the left ventricles of the mutant and wild-type rats. However, both exon 4 and 13 mutations caused aberrant PDE3A phosphorylation, hyperactivity, and increased PDE3A self-assembly. Ca2+ imaging of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived cardiac myocytes with exon 4 and 13 PDE3A mutations revealed adaptive Ca2+ cycling, compared to wild-type cells. Earlier, the PDE3A inhibitor, milrinone, failed as a heart-failure therapy in man. We suggest instead that PDE3A activation, rather than non-selective inhibition, could be cardioprotective. Our findings could facilitate the search for new anti-heart failure treatments.},

	abstract = {High blood pressure (BP) is the major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants for BP, but functional insights into causality and related molecular mechanisms lag behind. We functionally characterize 4,608 genetic variants in linkage with 135 BP loci in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes by massively parallel reporter assays. High densities of regulatory variants at BP loci (i.e., ULK4, MAP4, CFDP1, PDE5A) indicate that multiple variants drive genetic association. Regulatory variants are enriched in repeats, alter cardiovascular-related transcription factor motifs, and spatially converge with genes controlling specific cardiovascular pathways. Using heuristic scoring, we define likely causal variants, and CRISPR prime editing finally determines causal variants for KCNK9, SFXN2, and PCGF6, which are candidates for developing high BP. Our systems-level approach provides a catalog of functionally relevant variants and their genomic architecture in two trait-relevant cell lines for a better understanding of BP gene regulation.},
